the required .Net Framework version (from `v4.7` to `v4.7.1`) to benefit from the most recent dependency updates (#595).\r\n* We updated the ILGPU documentation and all samples to be compatible with this release (#584, #593, #600, #602).\r\n\r\n# Summary of the changes related to the new Memory API\r\nThe new API distinguishes between a coherent, strongly typed `ArrayView<T>` structure and its n-D versions `ArrayViewXD<T, TStride>`, which carry dimension-dependent stride information (The actual logic for computing element addresses is moved from the `IndexXD` types to the newly added `StrideXD` types). This allows developers to explicitly specify a particular stride of a view, `reinterpret` the data layout itself (by changing the stride), and perform compile-time optimizations based on explicitly typed stride information. Consequently, ILGPU's optimization pipeline is able to remove the overhead of these abstractions in most cases (except in rare use cases where strange-looking strides are used). It also makes all memory transfer-related operations explicit in terms of what memory layout the underlying data will have after an operation is performed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it moves all `copy` related methods to the `ArrayView` instances instead of exposing them on the memory buffers. This realizes a \"separation of concerns\": One the one hand, a `MemoryBuffer` holds a reference to the native memory area and controls its lifetime. On the other hand, `ArrayView` structures manage the contents of these buffers and make them available to the actual GPU kernels.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```c#\r\n// Simple 1D allocation of 1024 longs with TStride = Stride1D.Dense (all elements are accessed contiguously in memory)\r\nvar t = accl.Allocate1D<long>(1024);\r\n\r\n// Advanced 1D allocation of 1024 longs with TStride = Stride1D.General(2) (each memory access will skip 2 elements)\r\n// -> allocates 1024 * 2 longs to be able to access all of them\r\nvar t = accl.Allocate1D<long, Stride1D.General>(1024, new Stride1D.General(2));\r\n\r\n// Simple 1D allocation of 1024 longs using the array provided\r\nvar data1 = new long[1024];\r\nvar t2 = accl.Allocate1D(data1);\r\n\r\n// Simple 2D allocation of 1024 * 1024 longs using the array provided with TStride = Stride2D.DenseX\r\n// (all elements in X dimension are accessed contiguously in memory)\r\n// -> this will *not* transpose the input buffer as the memory layout will be identical on CPU and GPU\r\nvar data2 = new long[1024, 1024];\r\nvar t3 = accl.Allocate2DDenseX(data2);\r\n\r\n// Simple 2D allocation of 1024 * 1024 longs using the array provided, with TStride = Stride2D.DenseY\r\n// (all elements in Y dimension are accessed contiguously in memory)\r\n// -> this *will* transpose the input buffer to match the desired data layout\r\nvar data3 = new long[1024, 1024];\r\nvar t4 = accl.Allocate2DDenseY(data3);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe major changes/features of the new Memory API are:\r\n- `Index1`|`Index2`|`Index3` types have been renamed to `Index1D`|`Index2D`|`Index3D` to match the naming scheme of `ArrayViewXD` and `MemoryBufferXD` types.\r\n- `LongIndex1`|`LongIndex2`|`LongIndex3` types have been renamed to `LongIndex1D`|`LongIndex2D`|`LongIndex3D` to match the naming scheme of the `ArrayViewXD` and `MemoryBufferXD` types.\r\n- Separation of concerns between `MemoryBuffer` and `ArrayView` instances:\r\n    - `ArrayView...` structures represent and manage the contents of buffers (or chunks of buffers).\r\n    - `MemoryBuffer...` classes manage the lifetime of allocated memory chunks on a device.\r\n- The `ILGPU.ArrayView` intrinsic structure implements the newly added `IContiguousArrayView` interface that marks contiguous memory sections.\r\n- The `ILGPU.Runtime.MemoryBuffer...` classes implement the newly added `IContiguousArrayView` interface that marks contiguous memory sections.\r\n- Types implementing the `IContiguousArrayView` interface provide extension methods for initializing, copying from and to the memory region (not supported on accelerators).\r\n- This PR adds the notion of `Stride`s. ILGPU contains built-in common strides for 1D, 2D and 3D views.\r\n    - `Stride1D.Dense` represents contiguous chunks of memory that pack elements side by side.\r\n    - `Stride1D.General` represents strides that skip a certain number of elements.\r\n    - `Stride2D.DenseX` represents 2D strides that pack elements side by side in dimension X (transfers from a to views with this stride involve transpose operations).\r\n    - `Stride2D.DenseY` represents 2D strides that pack elements in the Y dimension side by side.\r\n    - `Stride2D.General` represents strides that skip a certain number of elements in the X and Y dimensions.\r\n    - `Stride3D.DenseXY` represents 3D strides that pack elements in the X,Y dimension side by side (transfers from a to views with this stride involve transposition operations).\r\n    - `Stride3D.DenseZY` represents 3D strides that pack elements in the Z,Y dimension side by side.\r\n    - `Stride3D.General` represents strides that omit a certain number of elements in the X, Y and Z dimensions.\r\n- All `ArrayViewXD` types have been moved to the `ILGPU.Runtime` namespace.\r\n- All `ArrayViewXD` types do *not* implement `IContiguousArrayView`, as they support arbitrary stride information.\r\n  Note that the `ArrayView1D<T, Stride1D.Dense>` specialization has an implicit conversion to `ArrayView<T>` (and vice versa) for auxiliary purposes.\r\n- All `CopyFromCPU` and `CopyToCPU` methods are provided with additional hints as to whether they are transposing the input elements or keeping the original layout.\r\n- Note that `GetAsXDArray(...)` always returns elements in .Net standard layout for 1D, 2D and 3D arrays (this may result in transposing the input elements of the buffer on the CPU).\r\n  Use `view.AsContiguous().GetAsArray()` to get the memory layout of the input buffer.\r\n\r\nThis also affects the implementation of all `IndexND` types.\r\nWe moved the index reconstruction functions from the index types to the individual stride implementations:\r\n```c#\r\nIndex2D index = <some_extent>.ReconstructIndex(index);\r\n```\r\nNew way:\r\n```c#\r\nIndex2D index = Stride2D.DenseX.ReconstructFromElementIndex(index, <some_extent>);\r\n// .. or ..\r\nIndex2D index = Stride2D.DenseY.ReconstructFromElementIndex(index, <some_extent>);\r\n```\r\n# Summary of the changes related to the new Device API\r\n\r\nThe new Device API removes the enumeration `ContextFlags` and implements the same functionality in an object oriented way using a `Context.Builder` class. It offers a fluent-API like configuration interface which makes it easy to set up:\r\n```c#\r\n// Enables all supported accelerators (default CPU accelerator only) and puts the context\r\n// into auto-assertion mode via \"AutoAssertions()\". In other words, if a debugger is attached,\r\n// the `Context` instance will turn on all assertion checks. This behavior is identical\r\n// to the current implementation via new Context();\r\nusing var context = Context.CreateDefault();\r\n\r\n// Turns on O2 and enables all compatible Cuda devices.\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.Optimize(OptimizationLevel.O2).Cuda();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on all assertions, enables the IR verifier and enables all compatible OpenCL devices.\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.Assertions().Verify().OpenCL();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on kernel source-line annotations, fast math using 32-bit float and enables\r\n// *all* (even incompatible) OpenCL devices.\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder\r\n        .DebugSymbols(DebugSymbolsMode.KernelSourceAnnotations)\r\n        .Math(MathMode.Fast32BitOnly)\r\n        .OpenCL(device => true);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Selects an OpenCL device with a warp size of at least 32:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.OpenCL(device => device.WarpSize >= 32);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on all assertions in debug mode (same behavior like calling CreateDefault()):\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.AutoAssertions();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on debug optimizations (level O0) and all assertions if a debugger is attached:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.AutoDebug();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on debug mode (optimization level P0, assertions and kernel debug information):\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.Debug();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Disable caching, enable conservative inlining and inline mutable static field values:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder\r\n        .Caching(CachingMode.Disabled)\r\n        .Inlining(InliningMode.Conservative)\r\n        .StaticFields(StaticFieldMode.MutableStaticFields);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turn on *all* CPU accelerators that simulate different hardware platforms:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder => builder.CPU());\r\n\r\n// Turn on an AMD-based CPU accelerator:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder => builder.CPU(CPUDeviceKind.AMD));\r\n```\r\nNote that by default all debug symbols are automatically turned off when a debugger is attached. If you want to turn on the debug information in all cases, call `.builder.DebugSymbols(DebugSymbolsMode.Basic)`. At the same time, this PR introduces the notion of a `Device`, which replaces the implementation of `AcceleratorId`. This allows us to query detailed device information without explicitly instantiating an accelerator:\r\n```c#\r\n// Print all device information without instantiating a single accelerator\r\n// (device context) instance.\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(...);\r\nforeach (var device in context)\r\n{\r\n    // Print detailed accelerator information\r\n    device.PrintInformation();\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we removed the ability to call the accelerator constructors (e.g. `new CudaAccelerator(...)`) directly. Either use the `CreateAccelerator` methods defined in the `Device` classes or use one of the extension methods like `CreateCudaAccelerator(...)` of the `Context` class itself:\r\n```c#\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(...);\r\nforeach (var device in context)\r\n{\r\n    // Instantiate an accelerator instance on this device\r\n    using Accelerator accel = device.CreateAccelerator();\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Instantiate the 2nd Cuda accelerator (NOTE that this is the *2nd* Cuda device\r\n// and *not* the 2nd device of your machine).\r\nusing CudaAccelerator cudaDevice = context.CreateCudaAccelerator(1);\r\n\r\n// Instantiate the 1st OpenCL accelerator (NOTE that this is the *1st* OpenCL device\r\n// and *not* the 1st device of your machine).\r\nusing CLAccelerator clDevice = context.CreateOpenCLAccelerator(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Context` properties that expose types from other (ILGPU internal) namespaces that cannot/should not (?) be covered by the API/ABI guarantees we want to give, has been made `internal` properties. To access these properties, use one of the available extensionmethods located in the corresponding namespaces:\r\n```c#\r\nusing var context = ...\r\n\r\n// OLD way\r\nvar internalIRContext = context.IRContext;\r\n\r\n// NEW way:\r\n// using namespace ILGPU.IR;\r\nvar internalIRContext = context.GetIRContext();\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Using the Algorithms Library with the new Memory and Device APIs\r\n\r\nTo use the new version of the algorithms library with ILGPU v1.0.0, you need to initialize the library with the help of the new builder pattern:\r\n```c#\r\n// Enables all algorithm library features\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.EnableAlgorithms();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Improved CPU runtime to support arbitrary Warp/Group/Multiprocessor configurations\r\n\r\nThe new CPU runtime significantly improves the existing `CPUAccelerator` runtime by adding support for user-defined `warp`, `group` and `multiprocessor` configurations. It changes the internal functionality to simulate a single warp of at least 2 threads (which ensures that all shuffle-based/reduction-like algorithms can also be run on the CPU by default). At the same time, each virtual multiprocessor can only execute a single thread group at a time. Increasing the number of virtual multiprocessors allows the user to simulate multiple concurrent groups. Most use cases will not require more than a single multiprocessor in practice.\r\n\r\n*Note that all device-wide static `Grid`/`Group`/`Atomic`/`Warp` classes are fully supported to debug/simulate all ILGPU kernels on the CPU.*\r\n\r\n*Note that a custom warp size must be a multiple of 2.*\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new set of static creation methods:\r\n* `CreateDefaultSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 4 threads per warp, 4 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 16`).\r\n* `CreateNvidiaSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 32 threads per warp, 32 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 1024`).\r\n* `CreateAMDSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 32 threads per warp, 8 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 256`).\r\n* `CreateLegacyAMDSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 64 threads per warp, 4 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 256`).\r\n* `CreateIntelSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 16 threads per warp, 8 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 128`).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this PR adds support for advanced debugging features that enable a \"sequential-like\" execution mode. In this mode, each thread of a group will run sequentially one after another until it hits a synchronization barrier or exits the kernel function. This allows users to conveniently debug larger thread groups consisting of concurrent threads without switching to single-threaded execution. This behavior can be controlled via the newly added `CPUAcceleratorMode` enum:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// The accelerator mode to be used with the <see cref=\"CPUAccelerator\"/>.\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public enum CPUAcceleratorMode\r\n    {\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// The automatic mode uses <see cref=\"Sequential\"/> if a debugger is attached.\r\n        /// It uses <see cref=\"Parallel\"/> if no debugger is attached to the\r\n        /// application.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        /// <remarks>\r\n        /// This is the default mode.\r\n        /// </remarks>\r\n        Auto = 0,\r\n\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// If the CPU accelerator uses a simulated sequential execution mechanism. This\r\n        /// is particularly useful to simplify debugging. Note that different threads for\r\n        /// distinct multiprocessors may still run in parallel.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        Sequential = 1,\r\n\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// A parallel execution mode that runs all execution threads in parallel. This\r\n        /// reduces processing time but makes it harder to use a debugger.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        Parallel = 2,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, all `CPUAccelerator` instances use the automatic mode (`CPUAcceleratorMode.Auto`) that switches to a sequential execution model as soon as a debugger is attached to the application.\r\n\r\n*Note that threads in the scope of multiple multiprocessors may still run in parallel.*\r\n\r\n# Special thanks\r\nSpecial thanks to @76creates, @conghuiw, @deng0, @GPSnoopy, @jgiannuzzi, @Joey9801, @ljubon, @MoFtZ, @Nnelg, @nullandkale and @sucrose0413 for their contributions to this release in form of code, feedback, ideas and proposals.

  body: "This new beta offers significant performance improvements to the generated kernel programs and includes a lot of amazing new features ([get the Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ILGPU/1.0.0-beta1)).\r\n\r\n*Please note that this version has some breaking changes compared to previous ILGPU versions.*\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n* The `Memory API`, involving `ArrayView` and `MemoryBuffer` types has been significantly improved to support explicit `Stride` information (see below).\r\n* All `IndexX` and `LongIndexX` types have been renamed to `IndexXD` and `LongIndexXD` to have a unified programming experience with respect to memory buffers and array views (see below).\r\n* The `Device API` has been redesigned to explicitly enable, filter and configure the available hardware accelerator devices (see below).\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n* Added new `Memory API` to support explicit stride information (#421, #475, #483).\r\n* Added new `Device API` to enable, filter and configure the available hardware accelerator devices (#428).\r\n* Added support for `OpenCL 3.0` API (#464).\r\n* Added support for inline PTX assembly instructions (#467).\r\n* Added support for multi-dimensional and static constant arrays (#479).\r\n* Added support for convenient profiling use `ProfilingMarker`s (#482). \r\n* Improved CPU runtime to support arbitrary `Warp`/`Group`/`Multiprocessor` configurations (#402, #484).\r\n* Improved error messages (#466)\r\n* Enabled folding of debug assertions in `IRBuilder` (#477).\r\n* Fixed Group helper methods for multi-dimensional kernels (#481).\r\n* Fixed invalid code generation of `OpenCL` kernels in the presence of constant switch conditions (#441).\r\n\r\n# Summary of the changes related to the new Memory API\r\nThe new API distinguishes between a coherent, strongly typed `ArrayView<T>` structure and its n-D versions `ArrayViewXD<T, TStride>`, which carry dimension-dependent stride information (The actual logic for computing element addresses is moved from the `IndexXD` types to the newly added `StrideXD` types). This allows developers to explicitly specify a particular stride of a view, `reinterpret` the data layout itself (by changing the stride), and perform compile-time optimizations based on explicitly typed stride information. Consequently, ILGPU's optimization pipeline is able to remove the overhead of these abstractions in most cases (except in rare use cases where strange-looking strides are used). It also makes all memory transfer-related operations explicit in terms of what memory layout the underlying data will have after an operation is performed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it moves all `copy` related methods to the `ArrayView` instances instead of exposing them on the memory buffers. This realizes a \"separation of concerns\": One the one hand, a `MemoryBuffer` holds a reference to the native memory area and controls its lifetime. On the other hand, `ArrayView` structures manage the contents of these buffers and make them available to the actual GPU kernels.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```c#\r\n// Simple 1D allocation of 1024 longs with TStride = Stride1D.Dense (all elements are accessed contiguously in memory)\r\nvar t = accl.Allocate1D<long>(1024);\r\n\r\n// Advanced 1D allocation of 1024 longs with TStride = Stride1D.General(2) (each memory access will skip 2 elements)\r\n// -> allocates 1024 * 2 longs to be able to access all of them\r\nvar t = accl.Allocate1D<long, Stride1D.General>(1024, new Stride1D.General(2));\r\n\r\n// Simple 1D allocation of 1024 longs using the array provided\r\nvar data1 = new long[1024];\r\nvar t2 = accl.Allocate1D(data1);\r\n\r\n// Simple 2D allocation of 1024 * 1024 longs using the array provided with TStride = Stride2D.DenseX\r\n// (all elements in X dimension are accessed contiguously in memory)\r\n// -> this will *not* transpose the input buffer as the memory layout will be identical on CPU and GPU\r\nvar data2 = new long[1024, 1024];\r\nvar t3 = accl.Allocate2DDenseX(data2);\r\n\r\n// Simple 2D allocation of 1024 * 1024 longs using the array provided, with TStride = Stride2D.DenseY\r\n// (all elements in Y dimension are accessed contiguously in memory)\r\n// -> this *will* transpose the input buffer to match the desired data layout\r\nvar data3 = new long[1024, 1024];\r\nvar t4 = accl.Allocate2DDenseY(data3);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe major changes/features of the new Memory API are:\r\n- `Index1`|`Index2`|`Index3` types have been renamed to `Index1D`|`Index2D`|`Index3D` to match the naming scheme of `ArrayViewXD` and `MemoryBufferXD` types.\r\n- `LongIndex1`|`LongIndex2`|`LongIndex3` types have been renamed to `LongIndex1D`|`LongIndex2D`|`LongIndex3D` to match the naming scheme of the `ArrayViewXD` and `MemoryBufferXD` types.\r\n- Separation of concerns between `MemoryBuffer` and `ArrayView` instances:\r\n    - `ArrayView...` structures represent and manage the contents of buffers (or chunks of buffers).\r\n    - `MemoryBuffer...` classes manage the lifetime of allocated memory chunks on a device.\r\n- The `ILGPU.ArrayView` intrinsic structure implements the newly added `IContiguousArrayView` interface that marks contiguous memory sections.\r\n- The `ILGPU.Runtime.MemoryBuffer...` classes implement the newly added `IContiguousArrayView` interface that marks contiguous memory sections.\r\n- Types implementing the `IContiguousArrayView` interface provide extension methods for initializing, copying from and to the memory region (not supported on accelerators).\r\n- This PR adds the notion of `Stride`s. ILGPU contains built-in common strides for 1D, 2D and 3D views.\r\n    - `Stride1D.Dense` represents contiguous chunks of memory that pack elements side by side.\r\n    - `Stride1D.General` represents strides that skip a certain number of elements.\r\n    - `Stride2D.DenseX` represents 2D strides that pack elements side by side in dimension X (transfers from a to views with this stride involve transpose operations).\r\n    - `Stride2D.DenseY` represents 2D strides that pack elements in the Y dimension side by side.\r\n    - `Stride2D.General` represents strides that skip a certain number of elements in the X and Y dimensions.\r\n    - `Stride3D.DenseXY` represents 3D strides that pack elements in the X,Y dimension side by side (transfers from a to views with this stride involve transposition operations).\r\n    - `Stride3D.DenseZY` represents 3D strides that pack elements in the Z,Y dimension side by side.\r\n    - `Stride3D.General` represents strides that omit a certain number of elements in the X, Y and Z dimensions.\r\n- All `ArrayViewXD` types have been moved to the `ILGPU.Runtime` namespace.\r\n- All `ArrayViewXD` types do *not* implement `IContiguousArrayView`, as they support arbitrary stride information.\r\n  Note that the `ArrayView1D<T, Stride1D.Dense>` specialization has an implicit conversion to `ArrayView<T>` (and vice versa) for auxiliary purposes.\r\n- All `CopyFromCPU` and `CopyToCPU` methods are provided with additional hints as to whether they are transposing the input elements or keeping the original layout.\r\n- Note that `GetAsXDArray(...)` always returns elements in .Net standard layout for 1D, 2D and 3D arrays (this may result in transposing the input elements of the buffer on the CPU).\r\n  Use `view.AsContiguous().GetAsArray()` to get the memory layout of the input buffer.\r\n\r\n# Summary of the changes related to the new Device API\r\n\r\nThe new Device API removes the enumeration `ContextFlags` and implements the same functionality in an object oriented way using a `Context.Builder` class. It offers a fluent-API like configuration interface which makes it easy to set up:\r\n```c#\r\n// Enables all supported accelerators (default CPU accelerator only) and puts the context\r\n// into auto-assertion mode via \"AutoAssertions()\". In other words, if a debugger is attached,\r\n// the `Context` instance will turn on all assertion checks. This behavior is identical\r\n// to the current implementation via new Context();\r\nusing var context = Context.CreateDefault();\r\n\r\n// Turns on O2 and enables all compatible Cuda devices.\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.Optimize(OptimizationLevel.O2).Cuda();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on all assertions, enables the IR verifier and enables all compatible OpenCL devices.\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.Assertions().Verify().OpenCL();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on kernel source-line annotations, fast math using 32-bit float and enables\r\n// *all* (even incompatible) OpenCL devices.\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder\r\n        .DebugSymbols(DebugSymbolsMode.KernelSourceAnnotations)\r\n        .Math(MathMode.Fast32BitOnly)\r\n        .OpenCL(device => true);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Selects an OpenCL device with a warp size of at least 32:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.OpenCL(device => device.WarpSize >= 32);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on all assertions in debug mode (same behavior like calling CreateDefault()):\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.AutoAssertions();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on debug optimizations (level O0) and all assertions if a debugger is attached:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.AutoDebug();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turns on debug mode (optimization level P0, assertions and kernel debug information):\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder.Debug();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Disable caching, enable conservative inlining and inline mutable static field values:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder =>\r\n{\r\n    builder\r\n        .Caching(CachingMode.Disabled)\r\n        .Inlining(InliningMode.Conservative)\r\n        .StaticFields(StaticFieldMode.MutableStaticFields);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Turn on *all* CPU accelerators that simulate different hardware platforms:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder => builder.CPU());\r\n\r\n// Turn on an AMD-based CPU accelerator:\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(builder => builder.CPU(CPUDeviceKind.AMD));\r\n```\r\nNote that by default all debug symbols are automatically turned off when a debugger is attached. If you want to turn on the debug information in all cases, call `.builder.DebugSymbols(DebugSymbolsMode.Basic)`. At the same time, this PR introduces the notion of a `Device`, which replaces the implementation of `AcceleratorId`. This allows us to query detailed device information without explicitly instantiating an accelerator:\r\n```c#\r\n// Print all device information without instantiating a single accelerator\r\n// (device context) instance.\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(...);\r\nforeach (var device in context)\r\n{\r\n    // Print detailed accelerator information\r\n    device.PrintInformation();\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we removed the ability to call the accelerator constructors (e.g. `new CudaAccelerator(...)`) directly. Either use the `CreateAccelerator` methods defined in the `Device` classes or use one of the extension methods like `CreateCudaAccelerator(...)` of the `Context` class itself:\r\n```c#\r\nusing var context = Context.Create(...);\r\nforeach (var device in context)\r\n{\r\n    // Instantiate an accelerator instance on this device\r\n    using Accelerator accel = device.CreateAccelerator();\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Instantiate the 2nd Cuda accelerator (NOTE that this is the *2nd* Cuda device\r\n// and *not* the 2nd device of your machine).\r\nusing CudaAccelerator cudaDevice = context.CreateCudaAccelerator(1);\r\n\r\n// Instantiate the 1st OpenCL accelerator (NOTE that this is the *1st* OpenCL device\r\n// and *not* the 1st device of your machine).\r\nusing CLAccelerator clDevice = context.CreateOpenCLAccelerator(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Context` properties that expose types from other (ILGPU internal) namespaces that cannot/should not (?) be covered by the API/ABI guarantees we want to give, has been made `internal` properties. To access these properties, use one of the available extension methods located in the corresponding namespaces:\r\n```c#\r\nusing var context = ...\r\n\r\n// OLD way\r\nvar internalIRContext = context.IRContext;\r\n\r\n// NEW way:\r\n// using namespace ILGPU.IR;\r\nvar internalIRContext = context.GetIRContext();\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Improved CPU runtime to support arbitrary Warp/Group/Multiprocessor configurations\r\n\r\nThe new CPU runtime significantly improves the existing `CPUAccelerator` runtime by adding support for user-defined `warp`, `group` and `multiprocessor` configurations. It changes the internal functionality to simulate a single warp of at least 2 threads (which ensures that all shuffle-based/reduction-like algorithms can also be run on the CPU by default). At the same time, each virtual multiprocessor can only execute a single thread group at a time. Increasing the number of virtual multiprocessors allows the user to simulate multiple concurrent groups. Most use cases will not require more than a single multiprocessor in practice.\r\n\r\n*Note that all device-wide static `Grid`/`Group`/`Atomic`/`Warp` classes are fully supported to debug/simulate all ILGPU kernels on the CPU.*\r\n\r\n*Note that a custom warp size must be a multiple of 2.*\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new set of static creation methods:\r\n* `CreateDefaultSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 4 threads per warp, 4 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 16`).\r\n* `CreateNvidiaSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 32 threads per warp, 32 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 1024`).\r\n* `CreateAMDSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 32 threads per warp, 8 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 256`).\r\n* `CreateLegacyAMDSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 64 threads per warp, 4 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 256`).\r\n* `CreateIntelSimulator(...)` which creates a `CPUAccelerator` instance with 16 threads per warp, 8 warps per multiprocessor and a single multiprocessor (`MaxGroupSize = 128`).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this PR adds support for advanced debugging features that enable a \"sequential-like\" execution mode. In this mode, each thread of a group will run sequentially one after another until it hits a synchronization barrier or exits the kernel function. This allows users to conveniently debug larger thread groups consisting of concurrent threads without switching to single-threaded execution. This behavior can be controlled via the newly added `CPUAcceleratorMode` enum:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// The accelerator mode to be used with the <see cref=\"CPUAccelerator\"/>.\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public enum CPUAcceleratorMode\r\n    {\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// The automatic mode uses <see cref=\"Sequential\"/> if a debugger is attached.\r\n        /// It uses <see cref=\"Parallel\"/> if no debugger is attached to the\r\n        /// application.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        /// <remarks>\r\n        /// This is the default mode.\r\n        /// </remarks>\r\n        Auto = 0,\r\n\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// If the CPU accelerator uses a simulated sequential execution mechanism. This\r\n        /// is particularly useful to simplify debugging. Note that different threads for\r\n        /// distinct multiprocessors may still run in parallel.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        Sequential = 1,\r\n\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// A parallel execution mode that runs all execution threads in parallel. This\r\n        /// reduces processing time but makes it harder to use a debugger.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        Parallel = 2,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, all `CPUAccelerator` instances use the automatic mode (`CPUAcceleratorMode.Auto`) that switches to a sequential execution model as soon as a debugger is attached to the application.\r\n\r\n*Note that threads in the scope of multiple multiprocessors may still run in parallel.*\r\n\r\n# Major internal changes:\r\n* Added build support for .Net5.0 (#446).\r\n* Added support for T4.Build to automatically transform T4 text templates during build (#431).\r\n* Restrict net47 unit tests to only run on CI builds (#465).\r\n* Avoid duplicate CI runs for pull requests made from the same repo (#485).\r\n* Updated InlineList implementation to reduce memory consumption (#478).\r\n* Fixed invalid assertion affecting successor blocks in frontend (#445).\r\n\r\n# Special thanks\r\nSpecial thanks to @MoFtZ, @Joey9801, @jgiannuzzi and @GPSnoopy for their contributions to this release in form of code, feedback, ideas and proposals. Furthermore, we would like to thank the entire ILGPU community (especially @MPSQUARK, @Nnelg, @Ruberik, @Yey007, @faruknane, @mikhail-khalizev, @nullandkale and @yuryGotham) for providing feedback, submitting issues and feature requests.\r\n"

  body: "The new stable version offers significant performance improvements of the generated kernel programs and contains *critical* resource deallocation fixes ([get the Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ILGPU/0.10.0)). \r\n\r\n*It is strongly recommended to upgrade to this version as soon as possible to avoid resource and GC related deallocation issues.*\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n* The inheritance hierarchy of the `ExchangeBuffer` class has been changed to avoid exposing internal memory buffers. If you previously relied on the immediate inheritance from `ExchangeBufferBase` on `MemoryBuffer`, you have to adapt your program to use the intermediate base class `MemoryBuffer<T, TIndex>` instead (see [diff](https://github.com/m4rs-mt/ILGPU/pull/376/files#diff-371844bd1c86ba29dc0f5ee89f70c5764f4105dd60180a893ca150a9e5d36b4cL40)).\r\n* Properties exposing internal memory buffers of the high-level `MemoryBufferXD` classes have been removed to avoid ownership related GC-free issues (see [diff](https://github.com/m4rs-mt/ILGPU/pull/376/files#diff-fc821b55e008cf8c2c445d216fa349a6ed00d8e597bf263009e729474a4c21e1L134)).\r\n\r\n# Why are there breaking changes?\r\nWe have decided to remove dangerous properties from several memory buffer classes. The use of these properties can lead to program crashes, since buffers could be disposed asynchronously in the background by the GC without further notice.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n* Improved performance of kernel launchers by passing packed argument structures (#358, #372).\r\n* Graduated different optimizations from `O2` to `O1` (release mode) to improve performance in release builds using an additional of stable optimization passes (#344).\r\n* Graduated O2 optimizations in the `Cuda` backend to `O1` pipeline to generate vectorized IO operations in release builds (#350).\r\n* Added support for managed `sizeof` IL instruction (#380).\r\n* Added `PrintInformation` method to `Accelerator` instances to print detailed accelerator information (#389).\r\n* Added enhanced assertions and out-of-bounds checks to all `ArrayView` accesses on GPU devices (Use flag `ContextFlags.EnableAsserations` or attach a debugger to your application to enable assertion checks. Make sure to use the `portable` debug information format for detailed source location information) (#375).\r\n* Added support for printf-like output in Kernels for `CPU`, `Cuda` and `OpenCL` accelerators (#342).\r\n* Added new utility Launch/LaunchAutoGrouped methods to immediately launch kernels using a separate strong-reference cache (#336).\r\n* Added new `AlignTo` alignment methods to explicitly align `ArrayView` instances to a particular alignment in bytes (#316).\r\n* Added enhanced support for local memory via a new `LocalMemory` class (#316).\r\n* Added support for several `PopCount`, `CLZ` and `CTZ` operations (#324).\r\n* Added new `MemSet` functions to all memory buffers (#338).\r\n* Added new IfConditionalConversion to fold nested and-also and or-else block chains to `O2` pipeline (#328).\r\n* Added new local memory optimizations to simplify array accesses (#317).\r\n* Added simple 64-bit-based `LongGlobalIndex` helper to simplify correct computations using 64-bit integers (#337).\r\n* Added new `CLPlatformVersion` and fixed OpenCL 1.2 compatibility issues (#335).\r\n* Removed support for .NET Core 2.0 (#353).\r\n* Prevent using `SharedMemory` in implicitly grouped kernels (#354).\r\n* Prevent using `CudaAccelerator` and `CLAccelerator` instances to run on non-native OS .NET versions (#396).\r\n* Fixed *critical* GC-related resource deallocation issues (#376, #393).\r\n* Fixed returning correct length of dynamic shared memory buffers (#357).\r\n* Fixed invalid alignment information in the presence of reinterpret casts (#386).\r\n* Fixed invalid address computations of fixed array buffers (#361).\r\n* Fixed invalid PTX calling convention (#362).\r\n* Fixed edge cases in `LoopUnrolling` (#373).\r\n* Fixed invalid `printf` formats for `int64` and `uintX` types (#391).\r\n* Fixed invalid `DebugArrayView` implementations (#345).\r\n* Fixed invalid initializations of local memory arrays (#287).\r\n\r\n# Major internal changes:\r\n* Removed singleton instance of `RuntimeSystem` to avoid concurrency/reflection-API issues (#393).\r\n* Updated default optimizations for ILGPU debug builds (#384).\r\n* Added support for unity tests running on. NET Framework 4.7 (#355).\r\n* Migrated from FxCop analyzers to .NET analyzers. (#352).\r\n* Redesigned internal address-space inference passes (#364).\r\n\r\n# Special thanks\r\nSpecial thanks to @MoFtZ, @Ruberik and @jgiannuzzi for their contributions to this release and to the entire ILGPU community for providing feedback, submitting issues and feature requests.\r\n"
